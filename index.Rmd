## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to character representation on TV. Specifically, I am interested in how different underrepresented groups are displayed on TV and with what frequency. I would love to overlay this information with general attitudes to different identity groups over time to see how TV representation may or may not make a difference. I plan to find this data utilizing Google Data Sets.
